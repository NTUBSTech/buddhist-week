    headline: "Overcoming Restlessness and Boredom Through Mindfulness",
    content: `On September 26th, 2024, I had the chance to attend Bodhi Session 1 titled “Samadhi: About Boredom and Restlessness, Achieving Mindfulness through Meditation” was held. This two-hour session, led by Sayalay Sujata and supported by the Dhamma Study team, provided NTUBS members with valuable insights into restlessness and boredom from a Buddhist perspective, along with ways to face them through mindfulness.
  
  The session began with Sayalay Sujata's explanation of restlessness and boredom. She shared that Buddhism views restlessness as a natural response to uncertainty, while boredom arises from our attachment to constant stimulation. However, if both are left unmanaged, it can negatively impact our well-being. One of the most thought-provoking points was how Buddhist concepts like impermanence (anicca) could help us navigate these feelings. By recognizing the temporary nature of boredom, we might find freedom in accepting the present moment.
  
  Frankly, the topics discussed in this session resonated deeply with me, as they felt especially relevant to my university life. I was reminded of the countless times I’ve been consumed by worries about the future. This Bodhi Session prompted me, once again, to acknowledge the importance of slowing down; focusing more on the present moment rather than being consumed by uncertainties which could lead to restlessness.
  
  As the session ended, the room buzzed with lively chatter and warm smiles. Participants left with newfound knowledge and a sense of clarity, ready to face restlessness and boredom with mindfulness. A big thank you to the Dhamma Study team and Sayalay Sujata for organizing such an insightful event!`,

    name: "Children's Day Celebration",
    headline: "Overcoming Restlessness and Boredom Through Mindfulness",
    content: `Children’s Day Celebration has always been a special occasion in NTUBS, but this year’s celebration was truly unforgettable. The celebration was held at Little Bodhi Student Care Centre (LBSCC) on 4th of October. The moment we arrived; we were greeted warmly by the teachers and childrens that instantly triggered our spirits. 

We started the celebration after the childrens finished their lunch, while we had to prepare something beforehand. We splitted them into 6 groups since there were 3 game stations (Matching Ruby, Bounce It, and Scrambled Eggi). Matching Ruby is a game similar to a matching sentence game but uses a set of clothes from Growtopia instead of words. Bounce It, on the other hand, was quite popular among children because it is both challenging and fun. This game involves bouncing a small ball into a cup from a certain distance. Additionally, there were extra activities at this station, such as stacking cups into a tower and participating in quizzes. While the final station posed the greatest challenge, as it required teamwork. In this relay race, the children had to transport bottle caps using a spoon, collect puzzle pieces, and work together to solve the puzzle. 

Personally, I was quite exhausted since I had to take pictures of three station games simultaneously. However, I felt a deep sense of joy and nostalgia. Watching the children revel in their innocence and happiness reminded me of my own childhood and younger sister. What we all took home was the warmth of shared laughter and the pure joy of celebrating childhood. This Children's Day wasn't just for the kids; it was a heartwarming experience for everyone involved.`,

    content: `On 8th October 2024, the Dharma Study team held their first Kensho Session of the semester, an event I had eagerly anticipated. The session featured three speakers, each presenting on a unique topic.
  
  The first speaker, Bro. Zi Xian, discussed the theme “Buddhism is Secular and Sectarian.” My favorite part of his segment was the discussion on how laypeople can practice the Buddha Dharma in daily life. The diverse perspectives shared during this discussion were incredibly insightful, revealing practical ways to embody Dharma beyond the foundational practice of the five precepts. This enriched my understanding of how deeply Dharma can integrate into everyday experiences.
  
  Next, Sis. Rachel tackled the question, “Why is Dharma hard to understand?” She emphasized that understanding Dharma requires both an intention to learn and a commitment to applying it in daily life. Her practical tips resonated with me and inspired me to approach Dharma with greater intentionality and consistency.
  
  Lastly, Bro. Rendy concluded the session with “The Pen Story,” a metaphorical exploration of emptiness and change. His talk highlighted the principle that our experiences stem from the seeds we plant in our minds, meaning we have the power to reshape them. He provided actionable tips on fostering positive change, leaving us with a profound sense of agency over our lives.
  
  The Kensho Session was a fulfilling experience, offering not only intellectual enrichment but also practical tools to deepen my practice of Dharma. I am already looking forward to the next session!`,

    name: "Exam Welfare Dinner",
    headline: "Overcoming Restlessness and Boredom Through Mindfulness",
    content: `As a participant of the NTUBS Exam Welfare Dinner, I had the opportunity of experiencing a truly heartwarming and rejuvenating evening. Held on Tuesday, October 29th, 2024, at The Arc, the event provided a much-needed break from the academic pressures of the semester. 

As the sun began to set, we gathered for dinner and engaged in lively conversations with fellow NTUBS members. The evening commenced with a soothing opening puja, setting a peaceful tone for the event.  

Following the puja, we embarked on a creative and mindful activity - color-code painting. This calming exercise allowed us to express our thoughts and emotions on canvas, providing a therapeutic outlet to calm our mind. The diverse backgrounds and perspectives of the NTUBS members added a vibrant and enriching dimension to the shared experience. 

As the night drew to a close, we concluded with a closing puja, followed by the distribution of much-anticipated exam welfare packs. These thoughtful gifts served as a reminder of the Society's care and support for its members during this challenging period. To capture the essence of the event, a photo booth was set up, allowing us to create lasting memories with friends and colleagues. 

The NTUBS Exam Welfare Dinner was more than just an event; it was a testament to the power of community and mindfulness. By organizing such events, NTUBS fosters a supportive and inclusive environment where members can connect, relax, and recharge. 

I am truly grateful for the opportunity to have been a part of this wonderful experience. It was a night filled with laughter, camaraderie, and a sense of belonging. As we head into the final stretch of the semester, this is a night to remember. I believe that the positive energy and support gained from this event will empower us to face the upcoming exams with renewed vigor and determination.`,

    content: `On 7th – 8th December 2024, I attended a 2-days Mindfulness Retreat at Lin San Temple, which is held and organized by the Dharma Propagation team. This was the perfect opportunity for me to unwind and relax after a stressful month full of submissions and final exams. I was really looking forward to the retreat, especially towards the meditation sessions that can help me ease my post-finals worries.  

Once we arrived, our first agenda was to listen to Dharma Talk by Bro. Danry about introduction to meditation. Bro. Danry also explored topics such as mindfulness and compassion. This talk cleared up a lot of misconceptions that I had before about meditation and helped me understand that meditation can help us to be more mindful in our daily lives.  

After the Dharma Talk, Sis. Sujata guided us into a variety of meditation, such as mindfulness meditation, moving meditation and metta meditation. This was my first time experiencing moving and metta meditation, which makes me very excited about this session. It was a whole new experience trying both of these meditation techniques and I find myself really enjoying metta meditation. I can genuinely feel in tune with my mind when sending metta to all of the people I love, including myself. There is also one important takeaway that I can get, which is to love myself before loving others. 

Before ending day 1, we also watched “How to Make Millions Before Grandma Dies” and did some reflection on the movies. On Day 2, we continued with guided meditation by Sis, Sujata, focusing on our minds. All in all, these 2 days reminded me of the importance of mindfulness. A big thank you to the Dharma Propagation Team for organizing this event! `,
